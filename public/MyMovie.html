<h2>My top 5 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Armageddon</h3>
<p>This is the first movie that I've watched that is heavy on the CGI. It is also really cool movie when i was a kid</p>
<h3>2. Terminator 2</h3>
<p>This movie is my introduction to the franchise and since then I became a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
<h3>3. Avengers Trilogy</h3>
<p>This movie is kinda recent but it was really cool how all marvel movies is connected until to this movie</p>
<h3>4. Weathering With You</h3>
<p>This one is an anime and a real tearjerker one</p>
<h3>5. Deadpool</h3>
<p>Its just funny</p>
